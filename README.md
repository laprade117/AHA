# AHA - An AI-guided tool for the automatic assessment of venom-induced haemorrhage in mice

This repo contains the tool described in the paper [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fitd.2022.1063640/full).


We will hopefully have a more permanent link to the tool in the near future. Currently, you can access and use the tool via Google Colabs (requires Google Account):

We have also included an example image for you to try the tool with [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laprade117/AHA/main/example_image.png).
